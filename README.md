# Up like a bullet
It's a simple 2D platformer game, that was made for the graduation project of Salvador institute.
The main idea of the game is to reach highest point on the map as quickly as you can,
but one wrong step may couse you to fall down and lose youre progress.
The game was inspired by games like "Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy" and "Jump King",
but Up like a bullet is way more easy than them.
